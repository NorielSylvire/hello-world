# hello-world
My name is Emanuel Hongu Flaviu.
I am a Computer Science sophomore at the UCM.
This is where my projects will be published from time to time. Not all my code is posted here but most of it is open source, so it'll eventually get here.
Currently working on an incremental game using godot, which had me develop a few useful classes I will publish soon that will hopefully help other people in their projects.
I'm also developing a modpack/game with my own custom mods for minetest.
